EasyBank-Landing_Page

This project helped me understand a lot about the importance of details for the user experience and making a resposive landing page.

Desktop:

Learning to keep an eye on the details of the project, from the size template down to the button text.

The smallest detail like including the green underline that trasitions through each link really does bring your attention to where you're going to next.

Learning about grid, @include,and breakpoints, help me understand how to organize the display of a webpage.

Even though the mockup only include Desktop and Mobile, learning to include the "inbetween" like tablets helps to remeber to include all display sizes.

Tablet:

I had a problem where the .hero kept overlaying on top of the mobile menu. 
Learning what z-index was and where to place them was a real research kick in the butt! But managed to figure it out.
